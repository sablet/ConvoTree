# Chat-Line Project Overview

## Project Purpose
Chat-Line is a Next.js-based web application that implements a sophisticated branching chat interface. The application allows users to create conversations that can branch into multiple conversation flows, similar to how discussions can split into different topics while maintaining the overall conversation context.

## Key Features
- **Branching Conversations**: Messages can have multiple child responses, creating conversation trees
- **Branch Navigation**: Users can switch between different conversation branches via dropdown menus
- **Image Support**: Clipboard image paste functionality with preview
- **Interactive Message Selection**: Tap messages to select them as base points for new branches
- **Visual Branch Indicators**: Clear UI indicators when conversations split into multiple flows
- **Japanese UI**: Interface primarily in Japanese, indicating Japanese user base

## Target Use Case
The application appears designed for:
- Collaborative discussion platforms
- Brainstorming sessions where ideas can branch
- Decision-making processes with multiple alternatives
- Note-taking with non-linear thought processes
- Any scenario where conversation flow needs to split and merge

## Technical Context
This is a client-side React application with no backend dependencies, making it suitable for static deployment or simple hosting scenarios.
